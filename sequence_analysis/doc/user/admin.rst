documentation
=============

The sphinx documentation is now used to manage the documentation so as to 
include a reference guide as well as a User guide (and this administration
section).

docstrings need to be written.



Wrapper
=======

See the wrapping section

Test
====


Most of the functions have a test. The data structure such as Semi_markov, Sequences as  well.

Remains to be done : clean the test and use a common data.py file to create common data sets.


Questions
=========

* do we want a specific extension for all different type of data: top for tops, seq for sequences and so on ? or just .dat ?
* Discrete and sequences difference ?
