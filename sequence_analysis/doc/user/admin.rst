The wrapping of the CPP code is over and therefore all AML functionalities are now available in Python.

The test cover 80% of the code. 

The main point remaining is the writting of documentation as tutorials. 


documentation
=============

The sphinx documentation is now used to manage the documentation so as to 
include a reference guide as well as a User guide (and this administration
section).

Docstrings need to be checked or written.



Wrapper
=======

Remaing wrapping to be done: one Sequences constructor and one Vectors constructor.

Test
====

Most of the functions have a test. 

Questions
=========

* do we want a specific extension for all different type of data: top for tops, seq for sequences and so on ? or just .dat ?
