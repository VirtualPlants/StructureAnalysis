:Date: |today|

This manual details functions, modules, and objects included in 
VPlants.Sequence_analysis, describing what they are and what they do. For learning
how to use VPlants.Sequence_analysis see :ref:`sequence_analysis_reference`.

.. warning::

   This Guide is still very much in progress.
   Many aspects of VPlants.Sequence_analysis are not covered.

   More documentation can be found on the
   `openalea <http://openalea.gforge.inria.fr>`__ wiki.


The wrapping of the CPP code is over and therefore all AML functionalities are now available in Python.

The test cover 80% of the code. 

The main point remaining is the writting of documentation as tutorials.
